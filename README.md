<h3>About Bassa Vah</h3>
<p1>Also known as simply vah ('throwing a sign' in Bassa), Bassa Vah is an alphabetic script for writing the Bassa language of Liberia. It was invented by Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis inspired by the ancient symbols of the Bassa people. In the early days,type was cast for it, and an association for its promotion was formed in Liberia in 1959. However, these days it has fallen into disuse but there are ongoing efforts to revive the script.<br>
<br>
Vah is a true alphabet with a total of 38 characters, with 23 consonant letters, 7 vowel letters, and 5 tone diacritics, which are placed inside the vowels. It also has its own marks for commas and periods.Vowels in Bassa Vah are written as letters with obligatory diacritical marks which indicate the tone of the vowel. These marks are positioned on the interior of the largest partially or wholly enclosed space of each vowel glyph; the diacritic should be toward the center without touching the edges. Because the tone is obligatory (a Bassa word is misspelled without it) the un-marked vowels are never used alone.
